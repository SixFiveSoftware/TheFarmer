###The Farmer  

####What is this?  

The Farmer is an example created for CocoaConf Columbus 2015 for use in a talk by BJ Miller, titled "Testing, Testing, 1..<4". This is a very basic example of using TDD to create an object, in this case, a Swift struct.  

####If you want to go step by step  
The master branch has tags on it from step0 (the initial step) up to the final tag, with each step advancing the example. Start by typing `git checkout step0` from the command line in the project's directory, and examine the project. Then, type `git checkout step1`, and so on, examining the project at each step and running the unit tests.
